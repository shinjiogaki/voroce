## What is this?
**voroce** is a fast and simple voronoi class useful to create images like the above ones.
**voroce** is a coind word of **voronoi** & **veloce**.

I have a couple of ideas to speed up. So stay tuned!

## Cost Comparison (relative to naive 2d implementation)

| ---- | ----------: | ---------: |
|  2d  |        1.00 |       0.48 |
|  3d  |        6.48 |       1.18 |
|  4d  |       48.86 |      10.49 |
